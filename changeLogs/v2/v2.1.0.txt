All the libraries from this version are not compatible with the previous versions. <br>
1. The CLogsFile was updated to the version 2.1 - See the change list below:
    - Now the logs files has as extension `.log` instead of .txt
    - Now instead of `error code`, it says `code`, to avoid confusion on logs that are not errors.
2. Now the framework will verify that the autotrading and dlls are checked on the initialization, if are not, it will fail to initialize and `return false`, you can `bypass` this adjusting the settings.
3. Now the internal functions `FrameworkStart()` and `FrameworkInit()` return a `boolean` result instead of just being `void`
4. Fixed the bug of "no return" on the boolean methods of the `CTextFiles class` | Updated to 1.1
5. Now the `CTextFiles class` supports different files extensions like .txt, .dat, & .log | Updated to 2.0, it is completely compatible with the previews version.
5. Now the internal libraries have a defined version number. | Current version 1.0
6. Added the class CLocalTradeCopy - it is a new version of the offlineTradeCopier package but with most advanced features. You can still use the old package for small copy signals.
