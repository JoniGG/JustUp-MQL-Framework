### Version 1.0.3 <br>
1. Added the library Print Extended. It is a library that allows you to use the function Print() with more options. <br>
2. The library CFiles has been deleted.
3. Added the library TextFiles to handle text files. All the bugs related to the old CFiles library were changed. <br>
However, this library won't be included in the includer commands until the next major update 2.0.0. to avoid conflicts with the first pre-release. <br>
But, the file is already included in the repository, so you can added manually by uncommenting the line in the includer file in the common folder. <br>
